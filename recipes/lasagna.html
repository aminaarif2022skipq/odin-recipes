    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><span><strong>Meat:</strong></span>

        </li>
 
        <li><span><strong>Onion and garlic:</strong></span>
            An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.
        </li>
        <li><span><strong>Tomato products: </strong></span>
            You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.

        </li>
        <li><span><strong>Spices and seasonings:  </strong></span>
            This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.
        </li>Make the ricotta mixture.
        <li><span><strong>Lasagna noodles:   </strong></span>
            Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.
        </li>  
        <li><span><strong>Cheeses:   </strong></span>
            Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.
        </li>
        <li><span><strong>Egg:   </strong></span>
            An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.
